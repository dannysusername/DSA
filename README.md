DSA README
Overview
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice is a repository containing Java implementations of common data structures and algorithms problems. This project is aimed at skill enhancement through coding practice, focusing on optimization and object-oriented design. The code is organized in a readable structure with clear file naming and inline comments for easy understanding.
Features

Solutions to classic problems like binary search, sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).
Modular code structures for reusability.
Documentation for each solution to explain time/space complexity.
Test cases to verify implementations.

Tech Stack

Language: Java
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (recommended)

Usage

Browse the repository on GitHub at https://github.com/dannysusername/dsa to view the code implementations.
Navigate through folders for specific topics (e.g., sorting, searching).
Read the source files directly to see the DSA solutions and explanations.
