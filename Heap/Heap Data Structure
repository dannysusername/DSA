Heap Data Structure satisfies the heap property which states that every node's children node is greater than or equal its own value OR less than
or equal to its own value. Max Heap has the max value in the root node and min heap has the min value in the root node.

Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues. Queues that prioritize values are priority queues. Some examples are ascending order 
and descending order priority queues. descending order pq's prioritize smallest values and ascending order prioritize largest values first 
in a queue.

A complete binary tree is a tree where all levels are filled except the deepest and if the deepest level is not filled the nodes are filled from left to right.
Heaps allow insertion and deletion in O(log n). 

Heaps are used to create Priority Queues because of there effeciency.
